Music App

This is an app that was created as a homework assignment while I was a student at The Iron Yard in St. Petersburg, FL.
The assignment required us to use the SoundCloud API, Backbone, and Firebase while coming up with our own visual look.

As you can see I wanted to have a little fun with the bright colors while keeping it too out of control by adding
a grey to balance the brightness of the blue and green.

As a new comer to the Web Design world it was exciting to me to find examples of buttons that I could use and look at the
code to see how to make them work on my app.
